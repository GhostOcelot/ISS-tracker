# ISS-tracker

Vanilla javascript live International Space Station tracker. It shows live data such as geo coordinates, speed and altitude fetched from the wheretheiss.at API. I used Open Layers to display the map.

## Install and run

After installing the dependencies in order to run the app you need to build the bundle with parcel bundler:

`npm run build`

and spin the local dev server:

`npm start`
